I have been coding on and off for about ten years and have had thoughts about whether changing careers in software engineering would be a good move.  I've always enjoyed coding anything and everything but never really had the thought of having a job doing it.  The thrill of watching working code compile into an art was definitely satisfying.  I guess you can say that it was a hobby of mine.  Since the coronavirus pandemic, Flatiron was popping up literally everywhere on my laptop, my desktop, and even on my iPhone.  I decided to read up on Flatiron and see what it offered.  It was at that moment that I wanted to change my life and my career into a field that I have enjoyed for many years.  I currently am in a part - time cohort and I am having the best time collaborating with students about code.
