During the coronavirus pandemic, I was diving back into programming and checking freelancing websites to see if anything was available.  I wanted to brush up my coding experience and find projects to work on and even contribute to projects that were being created.  I realized that JavaScript has changed so much that my skills and experience were outdated.  Flatiron / Learn.co had a Javascript Fundamentals free course available to try and I immediately started it.  Thus beginning my career with Flatiron immediately ensued the countless hours of studying and practicing JavaScript fundamentals and advanced techniques.  With the addition of learning Ruby and Rails, my development of programming skills and experience was bringing back so many memories.  Practicing coding and understanding the structure has helped me with developing my JavaScript project.

I wanted to create a music app for my JavaScript project.  I realized that there have been a number of music apps created using different programming languages, including JavaScript and I felt hopeless, believing that I wouldn't be able to create something unique.  I wanted to ensure I had the basics set before I added advanced music abilities with JavaScript programming.  I searched musical apps and found different APIs to test with my project.  Incorporating musical sounds and melodies was difficult.  

The best part about practicing coding, especially in JavaScript, is having the ability to know and understand that there is more than one way of coding anything.
