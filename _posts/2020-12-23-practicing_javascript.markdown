A few years back, i had a health scare that ended up putting me into the ER at my local hospital for a few hours.  Really didn't think too much of it because I have always been in great health.  After being treated at the hospital, I decided to take care of myself and ensure that everything that I would do would be in the best interest of my health.  Since then, I have lost weight and worked out to stay in shape.

The reason why I am typing about my health is because my health has inspired me to create my JavaScript and Rails project.  I created a Workout Tracker that will help me see what exercises I have completed over time.  It's currently a simple, basic application that allows a user to enter a workout name such as 'Strength', 'Back', 'Yoga', etc. Once the user enters the workout name, a form will populate to allow the user to enter in information such as the name of the exercise being completed, the amount of sets, the amount of repetitions, and the time taken to complete the exercise.  Once that has been entered, the user will see their info populate on the screen.  The user also has the ability to delete the entire workout and enter in the info again.  I am looking to add a few more features to show a little more javascript capabilities, such as adding the date completed for the workout, total number of exercises in each workout, and so on.
