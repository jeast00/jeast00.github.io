<p>Currently unemployed due to the corona virus pandemic, but I am not willing to let that get in the way of my life!!!  Spent most of my life after high school developing skills, knowledge, and experience in multiple programming languages while working as a district manager in a dying retail company.  Staying positive and motivated is my go-to when the stress hits hard.  My daughter is my life... She is the main reason why I'm doing this.  As long as I commit to code and make friends during this journey, I know the only way is up.  Happy coding!</p>
